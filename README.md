# MPI Auto Installer
An automatic MPI cluser setup script for Ubuntu 22.04

This program looks to implement the bash script MPI installer outlined in the Project Pleiades research proposal.

The program installs and sets up an MPI cluster with openMPI as its default distribution. This program was specifically
crafted for a small hardware cluster built from 8 old office computers.
